## Requirements

If you are wanting to build and develop this, you will need the following items installed. If, however, you just want to run the application I recommend using a binary (See below).

- [Go version 1.24+](https://go.dev/doc/install)

## Configuration

You can create studies via a configuration file. See some examples in `/docs/examples`. It's one study per file.

You can then create a study by calling:

```shell
prolific study create -t docs/examples/standard-sample.yaml
```

You can also define some defaults in the configuration file: `$HOME/.config/benmatselby/prolific.yaml`.

Currently you can define the following:

```yaml
workspace: xxxxxxxxxx
```

### Environment variables

You will need the following environment variables defining:

```shell
export PROLIFIC_TOKEN=""
```

You can create a Researcher token in your [account](https://app.prolific.com/researcher/tokens/).

You can optionally override the URL for the API too. This will be set as default to the Prolific API URL. You can override this if Prolific have granted you access to a different environment.

```shell
export PROLIFIC_URL="https://api.prolific.com"
```

## Installation

You can install this application a few ways:
